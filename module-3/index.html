                            Among the numerous kinds of food, my favorite is Chole Bhature.  It tastes really fabulous.  Most of the Punjabis , love to eat Chole Bhature.  Chole Bhature originated from Punjab and was a basic part of the Punjabi diet. Chole Bhatureis a combination of Chana masala(spicy chick peas) and fried bread called bhatura from India.There are different varieties of bhatura available such as aloo bhatura (bhatura filled with boiled potato), paneer bhatura (bhatura filled with cottage cheese) etc. These breads are served with chick peas cooked in a gravy made of tomotoes, onions, garlic and garam masala a spicy mix. Sometimes, this chick pea preparation is also served with kulcha type of indian flat bread, naan or chawal (rice).It is usually eaten as breakfast, sometimes accompanied with lassi. chole bhatura are served with onions, carrot pickle, green chutney and achaar.  Bhatura chole is popular around north-west India.

                            Uttapam batter is made of a 1:3 ratio of vigna mungo and rice; Rice can be a combination of parboiled rice and a regular variety such as basmati.[1] The lentils and rice are soaked overnight, ground and fermented until it rises. The batter is spread on a hot pan, generally circular, toppings spread on it and patted gently. Oil is dripped around it, flipped when it is golden-brown, oil dripped again, another flip to make sure the second surface is baked too. The Uttapam is then ready to be served and eaten.Uttapam is traditionally made with toppings such as tomatoes, onion, chillies, capsicum and coriander ; other common choices are coconut, grated carrots and beets. It is often eaten with sambar or chutney. It is one of the popular dishes of South India.Uttapam from the streets of Varanasi (2007).Apart from toppings, the uttapam itself can be prepared differently by adding Kodo Millet.
